						I will work there sab to save up some money for our future and to repay my parents sa ilang gasto nako sa pag eskwela nako. Also to pay the rent sa amung house ddto kay mahal'2 jd 
						to ang bayranan ddto. Ayaw ka worry of anything ChaCha haaa. You got my words jud intawn and since the day I told you. But I'll just say it back here sa message. I'M ALL YOURS! and 
						will always be yours! HAPPY AND CONTENTED na intawn ko nimo. I'm actually shock ChaCha , that you still choose me and pursue jud kahit you already know na I will be travelling outside 
						Philippines na. I'm so blessed and thankful jud to have you. And Woi! don't think rajd og negatives haaa! But I know na naa jd tay times na ingon ana, kaya I would never get tired of giving you 
						assurance time to time. Also I know you cried dahil sa panghitabo. Ang mga anakins natin ang nag sulti saako na ganya you cried lge. Same rata, I also overthink a lot. I had sleepless nights. 
						Remever atung I told you about the sleepless nights nako and I told you na normal lng? I just said it tha way because I don't want you to worry and tungod jd to sa pag overthink nako. 
						But I always pray rajd. I pray for our health, ato relationship, our family, na will always be fine. And I will always trust you jd. Trust me too My ChaCha. Kay I would never break the 
						words na akung gi sulti saimo. I wanna talk to you personally about the negative things na ako gi pang think. I hope we could bond jd. So that we could fix up all our negative thoughts 
						na magpa bother nato. Kay dli ko ganahan na mo larga ko and ma layo ko nimo na naa tay gipang dala na nagpa bother nato both. I'll be honest with you sa kana na days. Hehehe I'll always 
						look up to us jd. And will always put you on to my future plans. Please take care always. Ayaw kalimot sa imung panyo if mag work ka. Ayaw ka sad if ingon ani malayo ta kay doo I'm always 
						be here for you. It may not be Physically but I'll be there rajd. One chat away and one call away rajd nis TanTan nimooo! I'll always look for time jd to bond with you sa chat. Kay I don't

						the partner rajd. But you, wala jud and you even show the flaws which made me to love you more. And to respond sa message nimo na, "TBH, you're one of the reasons 
						why I keep on going, like literally everyday." is ILOVEYOU. I didn't expect that tbh. And yes ako pud, ikaw sab jud ang usa sa rason na magpadayun jud ko everyday. 
						Especially kanang adlaw na kapuyan ko sa pag edit and etc. Pero sa isa lng na chat nimo isssa energy boost to myself. Salamat always na mo check jud ka nako if ever 
						wawla nako ka update tungod sa ka busy sa life nako. And ako sab mo check jud ko nimo if makalugar lng jd ko. Also ChaCha, just tell me honestly rajud ha if you wanna 
						talk about something. Kay I will always listen to you rajd. ILOVEYOUSOOMUCCHH!!!</p>
